Fourth Laboratory Assignment

1. Overview

The goal of this lab is to implement a code generator for the programming language PL/3007. In the first two labs, you implemented a lexer and a parser. A semantic analyser is provided in Lab 3. Hence, by the end of this lab you will have created a full compiler from PL/3007 to Java bytecode.

Like the previous labs, this lab provides you with a preconfigured Eclipse workspace (downloadable as a zip file from the course website) to get you started. The workspace contains several supporting files, which you do not need to touch, and several Java classes containing a partial definition of a code generator. The workspace also contains a rudimentary test suite, which you are encouraged to use and extend to test your implementation.

2. Setup Instructions

The basic instructions are the same as in the previous lab: Download the file lab4.zip from the course webpage.

Unzip it somewhere on your hard drive to reveal a folder lab4. Start Eclipse and import lab4 as a Java project into your Lab2 workspace. It contains a single project Lab4, which contains all the code you need to complete the project.

The code contained in this project is structured as follows:

‚Ä¢ folder src contains the source code:

‚àí package backend contains several Java classes comprising the code generator, as explained below;

‚àí package ast contains a visitor class explained below;

‚àí package runtime contains a single class Runtime which is the runtime environment of PL/3007 programs;

‚àí package test contains the test suite in file CompilerTests.java;

‚Ä¢ folder lib contains third-party libraries as well as a lexer (lexer.jar), a parser (parser.jar), and the

AST classes with embedded semantic analyser methods (ast.jar).

In this lab, no program generator is used, hence there should not be any build errors. Try running the test suite by right-clicking on Lab4 and choosing ‚ÄúRun As -&gt; JUnit Test‚Äù. This will bring up the JUnit pane on the left, where the results of the tests are displayed. Currently, there are only a few tests, and they fail: not too surprising, since we have not implemented any code generator functionality yet.

3. Problem Description

The code generator is structured into five main classes ProgramCodeGenerator, ModuleCodeGenerator, FunctionCodeGenerator, StmtCodeGenerator, ExprCodeGenerator, and a utility class SootTypeUtil.

3.1. Visitors

In the default implementation, the visitor method for node type ASTNode (which is the root AST node type that all other AST node types inherit from) returns null (which in Java is an acceptable return value, regardless of which actual type A is instantiated to). All other visitor methods invoke the visitor method for their super node type. The code generator visitors each override only a part of the visitor methods, and leave the other ones to return null.

To apply a visitor object v to an AST node n, use the method ASTNode.accept like this: n.accept(v). At runtime, this will invoke the appropriate method visitN, where n is the runtime type of n, and pass n itself as the only argument.

3.2. Code Generation

The ProgramCodeGenerator class is in charge of driving code generation for the entire program. You do not need to change anything in its implementation, but it is important to understand how it works. When compiling PL/3007 to Java bytecode, each module is compiled into a Soot class. The program code generator keeps a mapping module2class that maps every module to the corresponding Soot class. For a given module, you can use ProgramCodeGenerator.getSootClass to find the appropriate class; if no class has been generated yet, an empty one will be created at this point. The most important method in the program code generator is generate, which accepts a Program AST node (which is the root node of a program‚Äôs AST), initialises Soot, and then iterates over all the modules in the program and hands them off to the module code generator to generate the appropriate Soot class for it.

The ModuleCodeGenerator also does not need to be changed, but its code again should be understood. The module code generator simply walks over all declarations in the module and generates equivalent Soot declarations for them. In particular, it creates, for every field, a static field declaration with the appropriate type, accessibility, and name. The utility class SootTypeUtil is used to map from PL/3007 type descriptors to Soot types: note how a visitor is used to avoid lots of instanceof checks on the type descriptor. (Needless to say, you should not change anything in class SootTypeUtil either.)

Going back to the module code generator, code generation for functions is handed off to the FunctionCodeGenerator class, which generates a static method for each function declaration. Note that no code is generated for type declarations: such declarations only introduce new names for existing types and do not really define anything new.

The function code generator performs two main tasks: it generates a Soot method with all the code for the function in it, and it maintains the mapping from PL/3007 parameters and local variables to Soot local variables. The latter is done by the map sootLocalMap, which is managed by method getSootLocal. The function code generator also keeps a set of the names of all Soot variables that have been declared so far (generatedNames): this is important because in PL/3007 there can be several local variables with the same name in the same function as long as they are declared in distinct blocks. In Soot (as in Java), on the other hand, this is not allowed. For this reason, getSootLocal checks whether a local of the same name has already been declared, and if so generates a fresh name (by appending a number to the end of the variable name). Similarly, method mkTemp can be used to generate a fresh local variable with a unique name; this will be needed during code generation for expressions.

Finally, method generate performs the actual task of generating code for a function declaration. The details of setting up the required Soot data structures are tedious but not particularly complicated; you should study the code carefully, although you do not need to change anything. Code generation for the function body is delegated to class StmtCodeGenerator.

The statement code generator is a visitor class, with different methods performing code generation for different kinds of statements. Note that the visitor type parameter is Void, representing the fact that the statement code generator returns no values; it simply appends the statements it generates to the statement list in field units. (For somewhat silly reasons, the visitor methods still need to return null, however.) You are asked to supply the missing implementations of the visitor methods for BreakStmt and WhileStmt; the TODO comments will get you started, and Figure 1 below lists all the API methods you might need.

Finally, the expression code generator ExprCodeGenerator is again a visitor class, with different methods performing code generation for different kinds of expressions, each returning a Soot Value. It defines a utility method wrap that checks whether some value can be used as an operand (i.e., it is a literal or a variable); if not, it generates a new assignment statement storing the argument value into a fresh temporary variable, and returns that temporary variable. Hence, whenever you need to use the value returned by a recursive invocation of the expression code generator as an operand to another operator, you should use wrap to ensure that the result is a valid Jimple expression. Several visitor methods have already been defined, study them carefully. The TODO comments show you which ones you need to implement yourself. Again, refer to Figure 1 for a complete list of all Soot API methods you will need.

3.3. Testing

As always, it is very important that you write your own tests to test your code generator. Unlike in previous assignments, however, for this assignment you will no longer be writing unit tests (which test one component of the compiler), but system tests (which test the entire compiler).

Class CompilerTests contains a utility method runtest that makes it very easy to do so. This method accepts six arguments:

1. modules_src: an array of strings, each being the source code of one module of the program;

2. main_module: the name of the program‚Äôs main module;

3. main_function: the name of the main function (which must be declared in the main module);

4. parm_types: an array of Java class objects representing the main function‚Äôs parameter types ;

5. args: an array of Java objects to provide as arguments to the main function; 6. expected: the expected result.

The method will compile the given modules into JVM classes using your code generator, then load the class corresponding to the main module, and invoke the main function with the provided arguments. If the function runs without throwing an exception and its return type is either void or it returns an object that is equal to expected, the test passes. Anything else leads to test failure. There is also an overloaded version of runtest where the first argument is a single string, for the case of programs that consist of a single module. As an example, here is the invocation of runtest in the first test in CompilerTests:

runtest(‚Äúmodule Test {‚Äù +

‚Äù public int f() {‚Äù +

‚Äù return 23+19;‚Äù +

‚Äù }‚Äù +

‚Äú}‚Äù,

‚ÄúTest‚Äù,

‚Äúf‚Äù, new Class&lt;?&gt;[0], new Object[0],

42);

This compiles the given module into a JVM class Test, loads it, invokes the method f() of that class without arguments (note that both parm_types and args are empty arrays), and checks that the result is the number 42. Another example is listed below in which the method f() is invoked with appropriate arguments: runtest(‚Äúmodule Test {‚Äù +

‚Äù public int f(int x, int y) {‚Äù +

‚Äù return y;‚Äù +

‚Äù }‚Äù + ‚Äú}‚Äù,

‚ÄúTest‚Äù,

‚Äúf‚Äù,

new Class&lt;?&gt;[] { int.class, int.class }, new Object[] { 23, 42 },

42);
